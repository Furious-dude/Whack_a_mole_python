# Whack_a_mole_python
I made a whack-a-mole type game in python, with only tkinter

many of the features are missing, the timer is really buggy
doesn't have any saving system yet, and the replay system is just for fun(to be implemented)

but seriously, who does find this afternoon thought fun, please dm me :V
